# DownloadYoutubeVideos

This code is a simple GUI application built with Tkinter that allows users to download YouTube videos.
When the user enters a YouTube video link and clicks the "DOWNLOAD" button, the downloader function attempts to download the video. 
If successful, it displays "DOWNLOADED" on the GUI; otherwise, it shows an error message. The GUI remains open until the user closes it.
